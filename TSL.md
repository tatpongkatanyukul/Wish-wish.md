# Thai Sign Language

This is my research life line.
I may not be able to contribute much, but I'll keep working on it.

It is complex enough to accommodate my thrist for theoretical contribution,
but it also is still concrete and specific enough so that I do not have to be in the wide ocean of academic knowledge, full of "sharks".
